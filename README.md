  ## Description
  Welcome to Ripened Potatoes! A place where you can gush all about your favorite bad movies! There are tons of websites dedicated to sharing movie reviews about your favorite movie, but what about the films you love to hate? Ripened Potatoes is a place where worst comes to worst in all its glory. Whether you want to suggest a movie that’s a waste of time to that coworker who just won’t stop talking about Quentin Tarantino, or you just want to gush about the perfect imperfection that is The Room, Ripened Potatoes has you covered. These days, film buffs and movie critics are quick to whip up intellectual analyses about any film, but the beauty of Ripened Potatoes is that you can be seriously unserious.
